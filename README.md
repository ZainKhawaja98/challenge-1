## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

The company created a website for clients to visit in order to see what services they can provide. However, the website was not properly created and one of the links was not working as well as the source code having unnecessary elements. The motivation was to learn more about how HTML and CSS function and how to make them flow properly. This was done through many steps including removing the div from the index.html and adding alt attributes to images. This solved the problem of having source code that was hard to follow and not organized. I learned the structure of a website and how each element will appear.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage
In order to use the website, click the three links at the top of the website and it will direct you to the corresponding location. If the images aren't loading, there is text that will display and describe the message of the image.
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
